This one-day conference aims to inform the mathematical community, in the broadest sense, about recent advancements in artificial intelligence applied to mathematics, including new LLM models for reasoning and novel training techniques. It will also cover mathematical contributions to AI, such as specialized datasets for reasoning and proof assistants. A key focus will be on practical applications, with an afternoon hands-on session dedicated to the practical use of these tools to tackle various mathematical problems.
