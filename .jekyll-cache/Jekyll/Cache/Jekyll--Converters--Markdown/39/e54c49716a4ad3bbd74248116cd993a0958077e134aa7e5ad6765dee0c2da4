I"ﬂ<p>Welcome to the Data Science Colloquium of the <a href="http://www.ens.fr/">ENS</a>.</p>

<p>This colloquium is organized around data sciences in a broad sense
with the goal of bringing together researchers with diverse
backgrounds (including for instance mathematics, computer science,
physics, chemistry and neuroscience) but a common interest in dealing
with large scale or high dimensional data.</p>

<p>The colloquium is followed by an open buffet around which participants can meet and discuss collaborations.</p>

<p>These seminars are made possible by the support of the <a href="https://data-ens.github.io">CFM-ENS
Chair ‚Äú<em>Mod√®les et Sciences des Donn√©es</em>‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>You can check the list of the next seminars below and the <a href="../past/">list of past seminars</a>.</p>

  <b>Title:</b> <i>Causality and Autoencoders in the Light of Drug Repurposing for COVID-19</i><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and ultimately, of better decisions. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (genomics, advertisement, education, etc.). In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the integration of different data modalities (video, audio, interventional, observational, etc.). Using genomics as an example, I will first discuss our recent work on coupling autoencoders to integrate and translate between data of very different modalities such as sequencing and imaging. I will then present a framework for integrating observational and interventional data for causal structure discovery and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable from such data. We then provide a theoretical analysis of autoencoders linking overparameterization to memorization. In particular, I will characterize the implicit bias of overparameterized autoencoders and show that such networks trained using standard optimization methods implement associative memory. We end by demonstrating how these ideas can be applied for drug repurposing in the current COVID-19 crisis.
