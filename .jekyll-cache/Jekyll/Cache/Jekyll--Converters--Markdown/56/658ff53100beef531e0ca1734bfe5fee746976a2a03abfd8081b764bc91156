I" <p>Welcome to the Data Science Colloquium of the <a href="http://www.ens.fr/">ENS</a>.</p>

<p>This colloquium is organized around data sciences in a broad sense
with the goal of bringing together researchers with diverse
backgrounds (including for instance mathematics, computer science,
physics, chemistry and neuroscience) but a common interest in dealing
with large scale or high dimensional data.</p>

<p>The colloquium is followed by an open buffet around which participants can meet and discuss collaborations.</p>

<p>These seminars are made possible by the support of the <a href="https://data-ens.github.io">CFM-ENS
Chair ‚Äú<em>Mod√®les et Sciences des Donn√©es</em>‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>You can check the list of the next seminars below and the <a href="../past/">list of past seminars</a>.</p>

  <b>Title:</b> <i>Learning Solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation with Neural-Network Quantum States</i><br />
  <b>Abstract:</b> The theoretical description of several complex quantum phenomena fundamentally relies on many-particle wave functions and our ability to represent and manipulate them. Variational methods in quantum mechanics aim at compact descriptions of many-body wave functions in terms of parameterised ansatz states, and are at present living exciting transformative developments informed by ideas developed in machine learning. In this presentation I will discuss variational representations of quantum states based on artificial neural networks [1] and their use in approximately solving the Schr√∂dinger equation. I will further highlight the general representation properties of such states, the crucial role of physical symmetries, as well as the connection with other known representations based on tensor networks [2]. Finally, I will discuss how some classic ideas in machine learning, such as the Natural Gradient, are being used and re-purposed in quantum computing applications [3]. <br /> [1] Carleo and Troyer, Science 365, 602 (2017)<br /> [2] Sharir, Shashua, and Carleo, arXiv:2103.10293 (2021)<br /> [3] Stokes, Izaac, Killoran, and Carleo, Quantum 4, 269 (2020)
