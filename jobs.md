The [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS Paris)](http://www.ens.fr) invites applications for a Junior Research and Teaching  Laplace chair in data science at the postdoctoral level, funded by the CFM (Capital Fund Management) and the ENS. The chair is named after [Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace), who between many accomplishements, was [one of the early founders of statistical inference and data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#Analytic_theory_of_probabilities).

The Laplace chair aims at recruiting outstanding candidates in all areas of data sciences including theoretical statistics, machine learning, signal processing, computer science, applied mathematics and statistical physics, or working on applications to other sciences such as physics, biology, medecine or social sciences and economics.

Appointments will be for two years with a possible extension for a third year. Salary is competitive, according to international experience and qualification.

The successful candidates will carry out (deep) research, with reduced teaching duties, which will be adapted. Applications should consist of a single file and be send before November 30th, 2016 [by email](mailto:florent.krzakala at ens.fr).
