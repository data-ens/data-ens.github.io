The [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS Paris)](http://www.ens.fr) invites applications for a Junior Research and Teaching  Laplace chair in data science at the postdoctoral level, funded by CFM (Capital Fund Management) and the ENS. The chair is named after [Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace), who between many accomplishments, was [one of the early founders of statistical inference and data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#Analytic_theory_of_probabilities).

The Laplace chair aims at recruiting outstanding candidates in all areas of data sciences including theoretical statistics, machine learning, optimization, signal processing, computer science, applied mathematics and statistical physics, *or* working on applications to other sciences such as physics, biology, medicine or social sciences and economics.

Appointments will be for two years with a possible extension for a third year. Salary is competitive and the positions are endowed with travel resources.

The successful candidate will carry out research in ENS, with reduced teaching duties which will be adapted. Applications should consist of a single file and be send before January 31th, 2020 [by email to laplacechair2020@gmail.com](mailto:laplacechair2020@gmail.com).

- A cover letter ;
- A complete CV including a list of publications ;
- A research statement (maximum 4 pages in A4 format) taking into account possible interactions with research groups/faculty within the different department of ENS ([Computer science](https://www.di.ens.fr/), [Cognitive sciences](https://cognition.ens.fr/fr), [Mathematics](http://www.math.ens.fr/), [Physics](http://www.phys.ens.fr/?lang=en),[Biology](http://www.biologie.ens.fr/depbio/?lang=fr), etc.) ;
- Three letters of recommendation from senior scientists, to be sent directly [by email to laplacechair2020@gmail.com](mailto:laplacechair2020@gmail.com).
