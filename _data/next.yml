  title: "Searching for interaction networks in proteins: from statistical physics
to machine learning, and back"
  abstract: "Over the last century, statistical physics was extremely successful to
predict the collective behaviour of many physical systems from detailed
knowledge about their microscopic components. However, complex systems,
whose properties result from the delicate interplay of many strong and
heterogenous interactions, are notoriously difficult to tackle with
first-principle approaches. It is therefore tempting to use data to infer
adequate  microscopic models. I will present some efforts made along this
direction for proteins, based on the well-known Potts model of statistical
mechanics, with an emphasis on computational and theoretical aspects. I
will then show how machine learning, whose unsupervised models encompass
the Potts model, can be an inspiring source of new questions for
statistical mechanics."
