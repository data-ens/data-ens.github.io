  title: "Statistical phenomena in data selection and data enrichment"
  abstract: "Building powerful machine learning models and training them has
become increasingly possible thanks to new architecture, software infrastructure,
and the prevalence of foundation models.

Nowadays, developing a high-quality dataset for a specific use case of
interest is often the key bottleneck to successful machine learning applications.
I will discuss two approaches towards alleviating this problem: selecting highly informative
samples from a large dataset, and merging a small data sat with surrogate data from
a different source. In will overview some of the ideas in the literature on
this problem, and present some findings arising from the analysis of simple statistical
models.
