  title: "From generative models of protein sequences to evolution-guided protein design"
  abstract: "Thanks to the sequencing revolution in biology, protein sequence
databases have been growing exponentially over the last years.
Data-driven computational approaches are becoming more and more
popular in exploring this increasing data richness. In my talk, I will
show that global statistical modeling approaches, like (Restricted)
Boltzmann Machines are able to accurately capture the natural
variability of amino-acid sequences across entire families of
evolutionarily related but distantly diverged proteins. We show that
these models are biologically interpretable; they allow to extract
information about the three-dimensional protein structure and about
protein-protein interactions from sequence data, and they unveil
distributed sequence motifs. These models can be seen as highly
performant generative models - they capture the natural sequence
variability far beyond fitted quantities, and they allow to design
novel, fully functional proteins by simple MCMC sampling approaches.

<i>Bio:</i> Martin Weigt is Professor for Computational Biology at Sorbonne
Université, Paris, where he heads the research team "Statistical
Genomics and Biological Physics" within the Laboratory of
Computational and Quantitative Biology (LCQB). Combining his original
scientific background in theoretical and statistical physics with the
exploding data richness in genomics and biology, he is particularly
interested in the development of data-driven modeling approaches for
biological sequences, their evolution and de novo design."
