  title: "Inertial proximal algorithms for maximally monotone operators"
  abstract: "We present a Regularized Inertial Proximal Algorithm to solve convex optimization problems and variational inequalities. It is obtained by means of a convenient finite-difference discretization of a second-order differential equation with vanishing damping, governed by the Yosida regularization of a maximally monotone operator with time-varying index. These systems are the counterpart to accelerated forward–backward algorithms in the context of maximally monotone operators. A simple example illustrates the behavior of these systems compared with some of their close relatives."
