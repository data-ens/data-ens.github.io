  title: "Scaling up Random Projections with multiple light scattering"
  abstract: "Random Projections have proven extremely useful in many signal processing and machine learning applications. However, they often require either to store a very large random matrix, or to use a different, structured matrix to reduce the computational and memory costs. We overcome this difficulty with an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections literally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory. This is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering of light in random media. These efficient optical random projections are used in two different settings: to generate Random Features for kernel approximation and to iterate an Echo-State Network (a Recurrent Neural Network with fixed internal weights). This new method is fast, power efficient and easily scalable to very large networks: we reach sizes that exceed the RAM memory limit."
