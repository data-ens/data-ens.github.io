  title: "Scaling up the LASSO with interaction features"
  abstract: "Learning sparse linear models with two-way interactions is desirable in many application
  domains such as genomics. l1-regularised linear models are popular to estimate sparse models,
  yet standard implementations fail to address specifically the quadratic explosion of candidate
  two-way interactions in high dimensions, and typically do not scale to genetic data with hundreds
  of thousands of features. Here we present WHInter, a working set algorithm to solve large l1-
  regularised problems with two-way interactions for binary design matrices. The novelty of
  WHInter stems from a new bound to efficiently identify working sets while avoiding to scan
  all features, and on fast computations inspired from solutions to the maximum inner product
  search problem. We apply WHInter to simulated and real genetic data and show that it is more
  scalable and two orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art."
