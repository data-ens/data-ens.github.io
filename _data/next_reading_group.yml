  title: "Semidefinite programming in the era of big data"
  abstract: "Semidefinite programming (SDP) has now emerged as a powerful tool to
derive approximations to hard problems (such as maxCut), or as a stable
algorithm to compute exact solutions to some particular (computationally
tractable) instances of such problems (such as in phase retrieval and
matrix completion).

The work of Shor, Nesterov, Parrilo and Lasserre brought semidefinite
programming to another level by introducing hierarchies of semidefinite
programs. In those hierarchies, an original polynomial optimization
problem is approximated by a sequence of SDPs on variables of increasing
size. Despite their theoretical interest in terms of approximability and
stability, the use of such hierarchies is hindered by the size of the
variables involved.

In this talk I will address applications of semidefinite programming to
some large scale problems from engineering and information theory. In
particular, I will start by discussing how SDP hierarchies can be used to
improve the current convex relaxation for rank one matrix completion which
is based on the minimization of the nuclear norm. Going against the
conventional wisdom, I will also discuss possible scalable numerical
schemes for those hierarchies. As additional applications, I will briefly
address inverse scattering as well as deconvolution and super-resolution."
