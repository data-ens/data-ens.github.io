  title: "Machine Learning Glassy Dynamics"
  abstract: "The three-dimensional glass transition is an infamous example of an emergent collective phenomenon in many-body systems that is stubbornly resistant to microscopic understanding using traditional statistical physics approaches.  Establishing the connection between microscopic properties and the glass transition requires reducing vast quantities of microscopic information to a few relevant microscopic variables and their distributions. I will demonstrate how machine learning, designed for dimensional reduction, can provide a natural way forward when standard statistical physics tools fail. We have harnessed machine learning to identify a useful microscopic structural quantity for the glass transition, have applied it to simulation and experimental data, and have used it to build a new model for glassy dynamics."

  title: "Probabilistic forecast of extreme heat waves using convolutional neural networks and rare event simulations"
  abstract: "Understanding extreme events and their probability is key for the study of climate change impacts, risk assessment, adaptation, and the protection of living beings. Extreme heatwaves are, and likely will be in the future, among the deadliest weather events. Forecasting their occurrence probability a few days, weeks, or months in advance is a primary challenge for risk assessment and attribution, but also for fundamental studies about processes, dataset and model validation, and climate change studies. We will demonstrate that deep neural networks can predict the probability of occurrence of long lasting 14-day heatwaves over France, up to 15 days ahead of time for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa geopotential height fields), and at much longer lead times for slow physical drivers (soil moisture). This forecast is made seamlessly in time and space, for fast hemispheric and slow local drivers. A key scientific message is that training deep neural networks for predicting extreme heatwaves occurs in a regime of drastic lack of data. We suggest that this is likely the case for most other applications of machine learning to large scale atmosphere and climate phenomena. We discuss perspectives for dealing with this lack of data issue, for instance using rare event simulations. Rare event simulations are a very efficient tool to oversample drastically the statistics of rare events. We will discuss the coupling of machine learning approaches, for instance the analogue method, with rare event simulations, and discuss their efficiency and their future interest for climate simulations."

We study here the limiting 'effective' dynamics of some summary statistics for SGD in high dimensions, and find interesting and new regimes, i.e. not the expected one given by the population gradient flow.

  abstract: "Motivated by prediction tasks such as molecule identification or functional regression, we propose to leverage the notion of kernel to take into account the nature of output variables whether they be discrete structures or functions. This approach boils down to encode output data as vectors of the Reproducing kernel Hilbert Space associated to the so-called output kernel. We present vector-valued kernel machines to implement it and discuss different learning problems linked with the chosen loss function. Eventually large scale approaches can be developed  using low rank approximations of the outputs. We illustrate the framework on graph prediction and infinite task learning."

  abstract: "The recent success of machine learning suggests that neural networks may be capable of approximating high-dimensional functions with controllably small errors. As a result, they could outperform standard function interpolation methods that have been the workhorses of scientific computing but do not scale well with dimension. In support of this prospect, here I will review what is known about the trainability and accuracy of shallow neural networks, which offer the simplest instance of nonlinear learning  in functional spaces that are fundamentally different from classic approximation spaces. The dynamics of training in these spaces can be analyzed using tools from optimal transport and statistical mechanics, which reveal when and how shallow neural networks can overcome the curse of dimensionality. I will also discuss how scientific computing problem in high-dimension once thought intractable can be revisited through the lens of these results, focusing on applications related to (i) solving Fokker-Planck equations associated with high-dimensional systems displaying metastability and (ii) sampling Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions using generative models to assist MCMC methods."

  abstract: "Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and ultimately, of better decisions. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of perturbation / intervention data (genomics, advertisement, education, etc.). In order to obtain mechanistic insights from such data, a major challenge is the integration of different data modalities (video, audio, interventional, observational, etc.). Using genomics as an example, I will first discuss our recent work on coupling autoencoders to integrate and translate between data of very different modalities such as sequencing and imaging. I will then present a framework for integrating observational and interventional data for causal structure discovery and characterize the causal relationships that are identifiable from such data. We then provide a theoretical analysis of autoencoders linking overparameterization to memorization. In particular, I will characterize the implicit bias of overparameterized autoencoders and show that such networks trained using standard optimization methods implement associative memory. We end by demonstrating how these ideas can be applied for drug repurposing in the current COVID-19 crisis."

  title: "Sampling and Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using the Prior Implicit in a Denoiser"
  abstract: "Prior probability models are a central component of many image processing problems, but density estimation is a notoriously difficult problem for high dimensional signals such as photographic images. Deep neural networks have provided impressive solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly rely on a prior probability model of natural images. I’ll describe our progress in understanding and using this implicit prior. We rely on a little-known statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained to perform blind (i.e., unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce high-quality solutions for deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and compressive sensing.

I will then turn to an fMRI experiment testing predicted representational geometry in a nonlinear context-dependent task. These results provide a new window into learning dynamics in nonlinear neural networks."

  abstract: "Thanks to the sequencing revolution in biology, protein sequence
databases have been growing exponentially over the last years.
Data-driven computational approaches are becoming more and more
popular in exploring this increasing data richness. In my talk, I will
show that global statistical modeling approaches, like (Restricted)
Boltzmann Machines are able to accurately capture the natural
variability of amino-acid sequences across entire families of
evolutionarily related but distantly diverged proteins. We show that
these models are biologically interpretable; they allow to extract
information about the three-dimensional protein structure and about
protein-protein interactions from sequence data, and they unveil
distributed sequence motifs. These models can be seen as highly
performant generative models - they capture the natural sequence
variability far beyond fitted quantities, and they allow to design
novel, fully functional proteins by simple MCMC sampling approaches.

  abstract: "The massive datasets being compiled by our society present new challenges and opportunities to the field of signal and information processing. The increasing dimensionality of modern datasets offers many benefits. In particular, the very high-dimensional settings allow one to develop and use powerful asymptotic methods in probability theory and statistical physics to obtain precise characterizations that would otherwise be intractable in moderate dimensions. In this talk, I will present recent work where such blessings of dimensionality are exploited. In particular, I will show (1) the exact characterization of a widely-used spectral method for nonconvex statistical estimation; (2) the fundamental limits of solving the phase retrieval problem via linear programming; and (3) how to use scaling and mean-field limits to analyze nonconvex optimization algorithms for high-dimensional inference and learning. In these problems, asymptotic methods not only clarify some of the fascinating phenomena that emerge with high-dimensional data, they also lead to optimal designs that significantly outperform heuristic choices commonly used in practice."

To what extent can cognitive neuroscience continue to guide and intersect with the development of machine learning? To highlight potential directions to this major issue, I will present three studies that investigate the computational organization of brain processing. For each of them, I will show that we can use non-invasive neuroimaging techniques with high temporal precision to parse the computational stages of visual processing in the healthy human brain. Our results show that the raw visual input that bombards our retina is progressively transformed into meaningful representations by a hierarchical algorithm, distributed both over time and space. Finally, I will briefly show how these methods can now be applied to understand language processing in humans, and thus help us tackle the modern challenges of machine learning."

  abstract: "Contemporary media are fascinated by the applications of neural networks in creation. They regularly highlight moments when artificial artistic productions have \"deceived\" humans and \"replaced\" artists. All this seems to confirm that AI would have conquered up to the last ramparts of humanity: interiority and creativity.  The dialogue between an art historian, invested in the digital humanities, and an artist who is himself familiar with deep learning, invites us to change our perspective. A historical and materialistic approach makes it possible to better distinguish what is new in the apparent emergence of AI in the arts and to better grasp the implicit conception of art that develops there: the change of purpose of a new technique, which generates surprising results, is also a way of thwarting the assumptions of the contemporary economic system. It suggest criticism of it as much as it opens up new possibilities.

  abstract: "Even though current machine learning techniques yield systems that achieve parity with humans on several high level tasks, the learning algorithms themselves are orders of magnitude less data efficient than those used by humans, as evidenced by the speed and resilience with which infants learn language and common sense. I review some of our recent attempts to reverse engineer such abilities in the area of unsupervised or weakly supervised learning of speech representations, the segmentation of speech terms, and the learning the laws of intuitive physics by observation of videos. I argue that a triple effort in data collection, algorithm development and fine grained human/machine comparisons is needed to uncover these developmental algorithms.

  abstract: "Inverse Problems on graphs encompass many areas of physics, algorithms and statistics,
and are a confluence of powerful methods, ranging from computational harmonic analysis and high-dimensional statistics to statistical physics.
Similarly as with inverse problems in signal processing, learning has emerged as an intriguing alternative to regularization and other computationally tractable relaxations, opening up new questions in which high-dimensional optimization, neural networks and data play a prominent role.
In this talk, I will argue that several tasks that are ‘geometrically stable’ can be well approximated with Graph Neural Networks, a natural
extension of Convolutional Neural Networks on graphs. I will present recent work on supervised community detection, quadratic assignment, neutrino detection and beyond showing the flexibility of GNNs to extend classic algorithms such as Belief Propagation.<br>

  abstract: "I will describe our contributions to scientific ML workflow building and optimization, which we have carried out within the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science. I will start by mapping out the different use cases of machine learning in sciences (data collection, inference, simulation, hypothesis generation). Then I will detail some of the particular challenges of ML/science collaborations and the solutions we built to solve these challenges. I will briefly describe the open code submission RAMP tool that we built for collaborative prototyping, detail some of the workflows (e.g., the Higgs boson discovery pipeline, El Nino forecasting, detecting Mars craters on satellite images), and present results on rapidly optimizing machine learning solutions.<br>

  title: "Statistical challenges in analyzing high-dimensional experiments in molecular biology"
  abstract: "Molecular biology experiments frequently measure tens of thousands of measurements on a cell in order to obtain a full snapshot of the activity of the cell. Analysis of these experiments requires the integration of statistical techniques to the unique biological aspects of these experiments. In this talk I will give an overview the data challenges faced in these settings, as well as highlight how the solutions to these problems compare to those used in the wider data science community. I will illustrate these points with examples from my research in developing methods for the analysis of the measurements of mRNA abundance of cells."

  abstract: "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are systems which provide real-time interaction through brain activity, bypassing traditional interfaces such as keyboard or mouse. A target application of BCI is to restore mobility or autonomy to severely disabled patients. In BCI, new modes of perception and interaction come into play, which users must learn, just as infants learn to explore their sensorimotor system. Feedback is central in this learning. From the point of view of the system, features must be extracted from the brain activity, and translated into commands. Feature extraction and classification issues, are important components of a BCI. Adaptive learning strategies, because of the high variability of the brain signals. Moreoever, additional markers may also be extracted to modulate the system's behavior. It is for instance possible to monitor the brain's reaction to the BCI outcome.  In this talk I will present some of the current machine learning methods which are used in BCI, and the adaptation of BCI to users' needs. "

  title: "Searching for interaction networks in proteins: from statistical physics
to machine learning, and back"
  abstract: "Over the last century, statistical physics was extremely successful to
predict the collective behaviour of many physical systems from detailed
knowledge about their microscopic components. However, complex systems,
whose properties result from the delicate interplay of many strong and
heterogenous interactions, are notoriously difficult to tackle with
first-principle approaches. It is therefore tempting to use data to infer
adequate  microscopic models. I will present some efforts made along this
direction for proteins, based on the well-known Potts model of statistical
mechanics, with an emphasis on computational and theoretical aspects. I
will then show how machine learning, whose unsupervised models encompass
the Potts model, can be an inspiring source of new questions for
statistical mechanics."

  title: "Cosmostatistics: Tackling Big Data from the Sky"
  abstract: "Since the dawn of time, humans have been wondering about their place in the Universe.  Over the past century, advances in modern physics, technology and engineering, along with the unique possibilities offered by space missions, have opened new windows to explore the cosmos. All-sky surveys, with observations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, are the best strategy to fully understand and model the Universe in detail. Major upcoming research facilities, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and the Euclid space telescopes will provide key elements to addressing this challenge, by producing high quality data of petabyte volumes. These surveys prove to be a major 'big data' challenge, which require the development of innovative statistical methods essential both for the data analysis and their physical interpretation. I will present some highlights of this methodology and more specifically show how novel techniques of sparsity and compressed sensing open new perspectives in analysing cosmological data. These enable us to answer fundamental questions about the nature of our Universe with impressive accuracy."

  title: "Learning to Succeed while Teaching to Fail: Privacy in Closed Machine Learning Systems"
  slides: nothing
  video: nothing
  abstract: "Security, privacy, and fairness have become critical in the era of data science and machine learning. More and more we see that achieving universally secure, private, and fair systems is practically impossible. We have seen for example how generative adversarial networks can be used to learn about the expected private training data; how the exploitation of additional data can reveal private information in the original one; and how what seems as unrelated features can teach us about each other. Confronted with this challenge, in this work we open a new line of research, where the security, privacy, and fairness is in a closed environment. The goal is to ensure that a given entity, trusted to infer certain information with our data, is blocked from inferring protected information from it. For example, a hospital might be allowed to produce diagnosis on the patient (the positive task), without being able to infer the irrelevant gender of the subject (negative task). Similarly, a company can guarantee they internally are not using the provided data for any undesired task, an important goal that is not contradicting the virtually impossible challenge of blocking everybody from the undesired task. We design a system that learns to perform the positive task while simultaneously being trained to fail at the negative one, and illustrate this with challenging cases where the positive task is actually harder than the negative one. The particular framework and examples open to door to security, privacy, and fairness in very important closed scenarios. Joint work with Jure Sokolic and Miguel Rodrigues."

  title: "The brain as an optimal efficient adaptive learner"
  abstract: "Understanding how neural networks can learn to predict and represent time-varying variables is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. A key complication is the error credit assignment problem: how to determine the local contribution of each synapse to the network’s global output error. Previous work on solving this problem in spiking networks has either been restricted to linear systems (Boerlin, Machens, Deneve 2013; Bourdoukan, Deneve 2015), or to non-local learning rules (FORCE learning; Sussillo, Abbott 2009; Thalmeier et al 2016). Here we show how to learn arbitrary non-linear dynamical systems with local learning rules. Our approach uses tools from adaptive control theory, and applies them to a spiking network with nonlinear dendrites. The spiking network receives its own tracking error through feedback and learns to approximate a nonlinear dynamical systems using a purely local learning rule. The local credit assignment problem is solved because each neuron effectively contains partial information of the error made by the entire network. This error is captured by the tightly balanced voltage of each neuron. Here, a balanced network effectively acts as a predictive auto-encoder that learns to cancel its own error and feedback. The resulting network is extremely efficient in terms of the number of spikes fired, and it is highly robust to noise and neural elimination. It produces asynchronous, irregular spiking activity matching the Poisson-like neural variability observed experimentally. Our framework has several important implications. It suggests that a global learning problem, like learning to implement complex nonlinear dynamics from examples, can be solved with local rules, as long as output errors are fed back as driving input signals. Our approach inherits the analytical tools of control theory such as convergence and stability theorems that can now be applied to learning in spiking networks."

  title: "Beyond stochastic gradient descent for large-scale machine learning"
  abstract: "Many machine learning and signal processing problems are traditionally cast as convex optimization problems. A common difficulty in solving these problems is the size of the data, where there are many observations ('large n') and each of these is large ('large p'). In this setting, online algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent which pass over the data only once, are usually preferred over batch algorithms, which require multiple passes over the data. In this talk, I will show how the smoothness of loss functions may be used to design novel algorithms with improved behavior, both in theory and practice: in the ideal infinite-data setting, an efficient novel Newton-based stochastic approximation algorithm leads to a convergence rate of O(1/n) without strong convexity assumptions, while in the practical finite-data setting, an appropriate combination of batch and online algorithms leads to unexpected behaviors, such as a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems, with an iteration cost similar to stochastic gradient descent.

  title: "Intelligence artificielle et raisonnement inductif : de la théorie de
l'information aux réseaux de neurones artificiels"
  abstract: "Les problèmes de raisonnement inductif ou d'extrapolation comme \"deviner
            la suite d'une série de nombres\", ou plus généralement, \"comprendre la
            structure cachée dans des observations\", sont fondamentaux si l'on veut
            un jour construire une intelligence artificielle. On a parfois
            l'impression que ces problèmes ne sont pas mathématiquement bien définis.
            Or il existe une théorie mathématique rigoureuse du raisonnement inductif
            et de l'extrapolation, basée sur la théorie de l'information. Cette
            théorie est très élégante, mais difficile à appliquer.

  title: "A big data approach towards functional brain mapping"
  video: nothing
  slides: nothing
  abstract: "Functional neuroimaging offers a unique view on brain functional organization, which is broadly characterized by two features: the   segregation of brain territories into functionally specialized regions, and the integration of these regions into networks of coherent
  activity.  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging yields a spatially resolved, yet noisy view of this organization. It also yields useful measurements of brain integrity to compare populations and characterize brain diseases.
  To extract information from these data, a popular strategy is to rely on  supervised classification settings, where signal patterns are used to predict the experimental task performed by the subject during a given  experiment, which is a proxy for the cognitive or mental state of this  subject.  In this talk we will describe how the reliance on large data copora changes the picture: it boosts the generalizability of the results and provides meaningful priors to analyze novel datasets.  We will discuss the challenges posed by these analytic approaches, with an emphasis on computational aspects, and how the use of non-labelled data can be further used to improve the model learned from brain  activity data."

I will then discuss phase transitions in two problems of interest to a broad range of data sciences: community detection in social and biological networks, and clustering of sparse high-dimensional data. In both cases, if our data becomes too sparse or too noisy, it suddenly becomes impossible to find the underlying pattern, or even tell if there is one. Physics both helps us locate these phase transiitons, and design optimal algorithms that succeed all the way up to this point. Along the way, I will visit ideas from computational complexity, random graphs, random matrices, and spin glass theory."

  abstract: "As the cost and throughput of genomic technologies reach a point where DNA sequencing is close to becoming a routine exam at the clinics, there is a lot of hope that treatments of diseases like cancer can dramatically improve by a digital revolution in medicine, where smart algorithms analyze « big medical data »  to help doctors take the best decisions for each patient or to suggest new directions for drug development. While artificial intelligence and machine learning-based algorithms have indeed had a great impact on many data-rich fields, their application on genomic data raises numerous computational and mathematical challenges that I will illustrate on a few examples of patient stratification or drug response prediction from genomic data."
