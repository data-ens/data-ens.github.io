  title: "Intelligence artificielle et raisonnement inductif : de la théorie de
l'information aux réseaux de neurones artificiels"
  abstract: "Les problèmes de raisonnement inductif ou d'extrapolation comme \"deviner
            la suite d'une série de nombres\", ou plus généralement, \"comprendre la
            structure cachée dans des observations\", sont fondamentaux si l'on veut
            un jour construire une intelligence artificielle. On a parfois
            l'impression que ces problèmes ne sont pas mathématiquement bien définis.
            Or il existe une théorie mathématique rigoureuse du raisonnement inductif
            et de l'extrapolation, basée sur la théorie de l'information. Cette
            théorie est très élégante, mais difficile à appliquer.
            <br/>
            En pratique aujourd'hui, ce sont les réseaux de neurones qui donnent les
            meilleurs résultats sur toute une série de problèmes concrets d'induction
            et d'apprentissage (vision, reconnaissance de la parole, récemment le jeu
            de Go ou les voitures sans pilote...) Je ferai le point sur quelques-uns
            des principes mathématiques sous-jacents et sur leur lien avec la théorie
            de l'information.
            <br/>
            <i>Short bio:</i> Yann Ollivier is a researcher in computer science and
            mathematics at the CNRS, LRI, Université Paris-Saclay. After starting his
            career in pure mathematics, with topics ranging from probability to group
            theory, he decided to move to artificial intelligence, with an emphasis
            on artificial neural network training, deep learning, and their links
            with information theory. In 2011 he was awarded the bronze medal of the
            CNRS for his work."

  title: "A big data approach towards functional brain mapping"
  abstract: "Functional neuroimaging offers a unique view on brain functional organization, which is broadly characterized by two features: the   segregation of brain territories into functionally specialized regions, and the integration of these regions into networks of coherent
  activity.  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging yields a spatially resolved, yet noisy view of this organization. It also yields useful measurements of brain integrity to compare populations and characterize brain diseases.
  To extract information from these data, a popular strategy is to rely on  supervised classification settings, where signal patterns are used to predict the experimental task performed by the subject during a given  experiment, which is a proxy for the cognitive or mental state of this  subject.  In this talk we will describe how the reliance on large data copora changes the picture: it boosts the generalizability of the results and provides meaningful priors to analyze novel datasets.  We will discuss the challenges posed by these analytic approaches, with an emphasis on computational aspects, and how the use of non-labelled data can be further used to improve the model learned from brain  activity data."

  title: "What physics can tell us about inference?"
  abstract: "There is a deep analogy between statistical inference and statistical physics; I will give a friendly introduction to both of these fields. I will then discuss phase transitions in two problems of interest to a broad range of data sciences: community detection in social and biological networks, and clustering of sparse high-dimensional data. In both cases, if our data becomes too sparse or too noisy, it suddenly becomes impossible to find the underlying pattern, or even tell if there is one. Physics both helps us locate these phase transiitons, and design optimal algorithms that succeed all the way up to this point. Along the way, I will visit ideas from computational complexity, random graphs, random matrices, and spin glass theory."

  title: "Can Big Data cure Cancer?"
  abstract: "As the cost and throughput of genomic technologies reach a point where DNA sequencing is close to becoming a routine exam at the clinics, there is a lot of hope that treatments of diseases like cancer can dramatically improve by a digital revolution in medicine, where smart algorithms analyze « big medical data »  to help doctors take the best decisions for each patient or to suggest new directions for drug development. While artificial intelligence and machine learning-based algorithms have indeed had a great impact on many data-rich fields, their application on genomic data raises numerous computational and mathematical challenges that I will illustrate on a few examples of patient stratification or drug response prediction from genomic data."
